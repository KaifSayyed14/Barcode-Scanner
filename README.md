# Barcode Detection and Decoding Script

This MATLAB script is designed to read and decode barcodes from an image. It uses the `imshow` function to display the input image and the `readBarcode2` function to extract the barcode's encoded message. If a barcode is detected, the script will display the decoded message; otherwise, it will output a message indicating that no barcode was detected.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (with Image Processing Toolbox if `readBarcode2` is part of the toolbox).
- An image file (`x`) with a barcode for testing.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the image containing the barcode is available and loaded into the variable `x` in your MATLAB workspace.
2. Run the script to display the barcode image and detect its encoded message.

### Code Explanation

```matlab
clc                  % Clear the command window
clear all            % Clear all variables
close all            % Close all figure windows
warning              % Display any warnings if they arise

imshow(x);           % Display the input image 'x'

msg = readBarcode2(x);   % Attempt to decode the barcode from the image

if (msg ~= "")           % Check if a message was successfully decoded
    disp(msg);           % Display the decoded message
else
    disp("barcode not detected");   % Display a failure message if no barcode is detected
end
